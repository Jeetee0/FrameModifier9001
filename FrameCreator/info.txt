FrameCreator:

This Program was written for the lecture "Vertiefung Programmieren" in fifth semester at the HTW Berlin.
It was created with Qt creator using Qt 5.10.0 MinGW 32bit.

With the program you can easily design patterns that can then transferred to some "max7219 8x8LED matrixes". 
In my example I am using 2x2 matrixes, resulting in a 16x16 LED matrix.

- for easier usage you can use the "+" key on your keyboard to add frames.
- the delaytime will be the time waited before a new frame gets printed to the matrixes
- preview mode gives an insight how it will roughly look on the matrixes
- you can save specific sequences and build them all together when using the load - append function.


You can export your project to get a frames.txt file that can then interpreted by my python library on a raspberry pi.
For that you need the SPI kernel driver enabled. Also you will need the luma.led_matrix library.
Best is to follow this guide to get the neccessary libraries: https://luma-led-matrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

You can then clone my git repo and play with the code: https://github.com/Jeetee0/FrameModifier9001.git
Keep in mind that the FrameCreator is designed for four matrixes in total.
